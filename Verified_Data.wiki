<i> Verified data is statically anchored in space and time. </i>
It has been secured by the power of time. You cannot manipulate it without breaking verification. Proof us wrong!

We make data verifiable by:
* verifying the integrity of a [[Page-File]], it's [[Content]] and it's [[Metadata]] by turning it into a [[Permissioned Blockchain]]
* anchoring it uniquely in space by giving it a unique name for each [[Revision]] which is turned into a block of arbitrary size.
* making the account verifiable by [[entangling]] your [[Ethereum-Wallet]] account with the [[Page-File]] and allow it to become an [[Identity]] through the entanglement of [[Identity-Claims]]
* by [[entangling]] your [[Page-File]] in time by proofing it's existence through time-stamping to a witness network
